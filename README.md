# Flutter-API-Data-Fetching-and-Display
This project demonstrates how to fetch data from a public API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) and display the results in a Flutter app. The app retrieves a list of posts from the API and presents them in a scrollable list. The app also provides a loading indicator while data is being fetched and handles errors gracefully.
